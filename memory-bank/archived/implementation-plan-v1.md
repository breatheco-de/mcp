Here's a detailed **incremental implementation plan** to build a minimal MCP-compliant server, with clearly defined, testable milestones at each step. Each step is small and focused on a single responsibility, allowing you to test functionality progressively.

---

## 🧩 MCP Server Implementation Plan

### ✅ Phase 1: Project Setup

1. **Initialize project**

   * Create a new project folder.
   * Initialize with a package manager (e.g., `npm init`).
   * Create `bin/` and `src/` directories.

2. **Set up CLI entry point**

   * Create an executable file in `bin/` that will be the `npx`-callable entry.

3. **Run a dummy script via `npx`**

   * Confirm you can run `npx ./bin/index.js` and see output.
   * ✅ **Test:** Confirm that a console log prints something like "MCP Server starting…".

---

### 🌐 Phase 2: Basic HTTP Server

4. **Implement a minimal HTTP server**

   * Bind to `localhost` on a fixed port (e.g., `4321`).

5. **Add a root route `/`**

   * Return a plain-text "OK" response.

6. **Test the HTTP server**

   * ✅ **Test:** Open `http://localhost:4321/` in a browser or use `curl` to confirm "OK" is returned.

---

### 📄 Phase 3: MCP Manifest

7. **Create manifest data structure**

   * Use a separate file to define MCP manifest metadata.

8. **Serve `/.well-known/mcp-manifest.json`**

   * Respond with a valid JSON manifest at the required route.

9. **Test manifest availability**

   * ✅ **Test:** Request `http://localhost:4321/.well-known/mcp-manifest.json` and confirm structure.

---

### 💬 Phase 4: Implement `/chat` Endpoint

10. **Add `/chat` route (POST only)**

    * Accept a JSON payload with a `message` field.

11. **Respond with simple echo reply**

    * Format a JSON reply: `{ reply: "Echo: <message>" }`.

12. **Test basic chat functionality**

    * ✅ **Test:** Use Postman or `curl` to POST to `/chat` and verify the echoed message.

---

### 🗂️ Phase 5: Integration via `mcpServers.json`

13. **Create the `.mcp` directory if it doesn’t exist**

    * Store config in the user’s home directory.

14. **Write entry to `~/.mcp/mcpServers.json`**

    * Add this server’s name and URL to the array of MCP servers.

15. **Test agent discovery**

    * ✅ **Test:** Open and verify that your server appears in `~/.mcp/mcpServers.json`.

---

### ⚙️ Phase 6: Dynamic Configuration and Port Handling

16. **Add optional support for environment-based port**

    * Use `PORT` from env vars, fallback to default.

17. **Make server configurable through CLI or env**

    * Allow optional arguments (e.g., config file path, port override).

18. **Test port override and config loading**

    * ✅ **Test:** Run server with a custom port and confirm it's reflected in URL and manifest.

---

### 🧪 Phase 7: Final Sanity Checks

19. **Test all endpoints together**

    * Run a test suite or manual checks on:

      * `/` root
      * `/.well-known/mcp-manifest.json`
      * `/chat` POST

20. **Simulate another agent discovering and using your agent**

    * Manually or via tool (like Cursor or Claude), test discovery and interaction.

Let me know if you'd like a CLI command to auto-register the agent in `mcpServers.json` or if you want to add support for capabilities like `/complete`, `/tools`, or real streaming in the next iteration.
