## MCP Server Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup

- [x] **Initialize project**
    - [x] Create a new project folder.
    - [x] Initialize with a package manager (e.g., `npm init`).
    - [x] Create `bin/` and `src/` directories.
- [x] **Set up CLI entry point**
    - [x] Create an executable file in `bin/` that will be the `npx`-callable entry.
- [x] **Run a dummy script via `npx`**
    - [x] Confirm you can run `npx ./bin/index.js` and see output.
    - [x] **Test:** Confirm that a console log prints something like "MCP Server startingâ€¦".

---

### Phase 2: Basic HTTP Server

- [x] **Implement a minimal HTTP server**
    - [x] Bind to `localhost` on a fixed port (e.g., `4321`).
- [x] **Add a root route `/`**
    - [x] Return a plain-text "OK" response.
- [x] **Test the HTTP server**
    - [x] **Test:** Open `http://localhost:4321/` in a browser or use `curl` to confirm "OK" is returned.

---

### Phase 3: MCP Manifest

- [x] **Create manifest data structure**
    - [x] Use a separate file to define MCP manifest metadata.
- [x] **Serve `/.well-known/mcp-manifest.json`**
    - [x] Respond with a valid JSON manifest at the required route.
- [x] **Test manifest availability**
    - [x] **Test:** Request `http://localhost:4321/.well-known/mcp-manifest.json` and confirm structure.

---

### Phase 4: Implement `/chat` Endpoint

- [x] **Add `/chat` route (POST only)**
    - [x] Accept a JSON payload with a `message` field.
- [x] **Respond with simple echo reply**
    - [x] Format a JSON reply: `{ reply: "Echo: <message>" }`.
- [x] **Test basic chat functionality**
    - [x] **Test:** Use Postman or `curl` to POST to `/chat` and verify the echoed message.

---

### Phase 5: Integration via `mcpServers.json`

- [x] **Create the `.mcp` directory if it doesn't exist**
    - [x] Store config in the user's home directory.
- [x] **Write entry to `~/.mcp/mcpServers.json`**
    - [x] Add this server's name and URL to the array of MCP servers.
- [x] **Test agent discovery**
    - [x] **Test:** Open and verify that your server appears in `~/.mcp/mcpServers.json`.

---

### Phase 6: Dynamic Configuration and Port Handling

- [x] **Add optional support for environment-based port**
    - [x] Use `PORT` from env vars, fallback to default.
- [x] **Make server configurable through CLI or env**
    - [x] Allow optional arguments (e.g., config file path, port override).
- [x] **Test port override and config loading**
    - [x] **Test:** Run server with a custom port and confirm it's reflected in URL and manifest.

---

### Phase 7: Final Sanity Checks

- [x] **Test all endpoints together**
    - [x] Run a test suite or manual checks on:
        - [x] `/` root
        - [x] `/.well-known/mcp-manifest.json`
        - [x] `/chat` POST
- [x] **Simulate another agent discovering and using your agent**
    - [x] Manually or via tool (like Cursor or Claude), test discovery and interaction.
